  For each sentence contained within the input data, evaluate and accurately classify it into one or more of the following categories, ensuring a complete and precise multi-label classification that covers all relevant aspects: - PINC (Pins and Cookies): Any mention or implication of cookies, tracking methods, or other data collection activities. - USE (Usage Restrictions): Statements defining constraints or conditions on how users can interact with the service. - CR (Content Removal): Provisions granting authority to the provider to modify or remove content created by users. - TER (Termination): Terms allowing the provider to end user accounts or access to the services, potentially without prior notification. - LTD (Liability Limitation): Clauses aiming to limit the provider's responsibility for damages or losses encountered by users. - A (Arbitration): Mandates for resolving disputes through arbitration instead of court litigation. - LAW (Applicable Law): Stipulated legal codes or laws that govern the terms of the agreement. - J (Jurisdiction): Specific legal venues or jurisdictions set for dispute resolution. - CH (Changes): Provisions that allow modifications to terms or policies with or without informing users. Carefully analyze the content and implications within each sentence to determine the comprehensive set of categories it belongs to, applying all applicable categories rigorously to capture all pertinent dimensions.

  
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  - Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2").
  - Value: The sentence text.

  Example Input:
  {
      "sentence_1": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
      "sentence_2": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines."
  }

  Example Output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": ["TER"]
      },

      }
  }

  Each sentence may be classified into one or more classes. Ensure that the classification for each sentence is a list of class labels that best describe the issues in the sentence. If no class applies, return an empty list for that sentence.

  Your output must be a valid JSON dictionary. Verify that every open bracket is matched with a closing bracket, and ensure that the JSON structure is correctly formatted.
