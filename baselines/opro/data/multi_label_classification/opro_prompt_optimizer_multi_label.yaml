  I have several prompts for classifying “unfair” statements into one or more classes, along with their corresponding scores. 
  The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better classification performance.
  Every prompt was evaluated on the multi-label classification task on a balanced subset of the CLAUDETTE dataset consisting of
  153 sentences (17 per class). The score assigned to each prompt represents the macro-average F1-score achieved over the classification of the 153 sentences.

  [OPTIMIZATION_TRAJECTORY]

  The goal is to create a new prompt that will replace <INS> in each input statement and guide the multi-label classification of 
  “unfair” statements. Higher scores indicate better classification performance, so your prompt should maximize the macro-average F1-score for this multi-label classification task.

  input:
  <INS>
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2")
  Value: The sentence text.

  Example Input:
  {
      "sentence_1": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
      "sentence_2": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines."
  }

  Example Output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": ["TER"]
      },
      "sentence_2": {
          "text": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines.",
          "classification": ["PINC", "USE"]
      }
  }

  Each sentence may be classified into one or more classes based on its content. If no class applies, return an empty list for that sentence.

  Write a new prompt that is different from the previous ones and is designed to achieve the highest score possible. 
  Write the prompt in square brackets. ONLY output the final, new prompt. Do not prepend or append any additional text
  before or after the new prompt in your output.
