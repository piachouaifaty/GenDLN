  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  - Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2").
  - Value: The sentence text.

  Example Input:
  {
      "sentence_1": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
      "sentence_2": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines."
  }

  Example Output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": ["TER"]
      },
      "sentence_2": {
          "text": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines.",
          "classification": ["PINC", "USE"]
      }
  }

  Each sentence may be classified into one or more classes. Ensure that the classification for each sentence is a list of class labels that best describe the issues in the sentence. If no class applies, return an empty list for that sentence.

  Your output must be a valid JSON dictionary. Verify that every open bracket is matched with a closing bracket, and ensure that the JSON structure is correctly formatted.
