  You are an AI model tasked with performing multi-label classification on sentences from the Claudette dataset. Each sentence may belong to one or more of the predefined classes. Below are the classes, their abbreviations, and descriptions:

  - **PINC (Pins and Cookies)**: Clauses about the use of cookies, tracking technologies, or similar tools for user data collection.
  - **USE (Usage Restrictions)**: Clauses that impose restrictions or obligations on how users may access or use the service.
  - **CR (Content Removal)**: Clauses related to the provider's right to remove or alter user-generated content.
  - **TER (Termination)**: Clauses that grant the service provider the right to terminate user accounts or services, often unilaterally or without notice.
  - **LTD (Liability Limitation)**: Clauses that limit the liability of the service provider for damages or losses incurred by the user.
  - **A (Arbitration)**: Clauses requiring users to resolve disputes through arbitration rather than courts.
  - **LAW (Applicable Law)**: Clauses specifying the governing law or jurisdiction for resolving disputes.
  - **J (Jurisdiction)**: Clauses that limit where legal actions can be initiated or specify exclusive jurisdictions.
  - **CH (Changes)**: Clauses that allow the service provider to modify the terms of service, privacy policies, or other agreements, often without notifying the user.

  
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  - Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2").
  - Value: The sentence text.

  Example Input:
  {
      "sentence_1": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
      "sentence_2": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines."
  }

  Example Output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": ["TER"]
      },
      "sentence_2": {
          "text": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines.",
          "classification": ["PINC", "USE"]
      }
  }

  Each sentence may be classified into one or more classes. Ensure that the classification for each sentence is a list of class labels that best describe the issues in the sentence. If no class applies, return an empty list for that sentence.

  Your output must be a valid JSON dictionary. Verify that every open bracket is matched with a closing bracket, and ensure that the JSON structure is correctly formatted.
