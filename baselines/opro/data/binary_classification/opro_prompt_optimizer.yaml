  I have several prompts for classifying statements as either “fair” or “unfair,” along with their corresponding scores. 
  The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better classification accuracy.
  Every prompt was evaluated on the binary classification task on a subset of the CLAUDETTE dataset consisting of
  100 sentences. The accuracy score assigned to each prompt represents the accuracy achieved over the classification of the 100 sentences.

  [OPTIMIZATION_TRAJECTORY]
  
  The goal is to create a new prompt that will replace <INS> in each input statement and guide the classification of 
  the statement as “fair” or “unfair.” Higher scores indicate better classification accuracy, 
  so your prompt should maximize the accuracy of this binary classification task.
  
  input:
  <INS>
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2")
  Value: The sentence text
  Input
  {
      "sentence_1": "You may be required to provide personal information for account creation.",
      "sentence_2": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason."
  }
  
  output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "You may be required to provide personal information for account creation.",
          "classification": "fair"
      },
      "sentence_2": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": "unfair"
      }
  }
  
  Write a new prompt that is different from the previous ones and is designed to achieve the highest score possible.
  Write the prompt in square brackets. ONLY output the final, new prompt. Do not prepend or append any additional text
  before or after the new prompt in you output.
