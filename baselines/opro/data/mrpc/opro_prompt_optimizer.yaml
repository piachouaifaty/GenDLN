system_role: |
  I have several prompts for classifying sentence pairs if they are paraphrases of each other. They are provided below along with their corresponding scores. 
  The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better classification accuracy.
  Every prompt was evaluated on the binary classification task on a subset of the MRPC dataset consisting of
  100 sentences. The accuracy score assigned to each prompt represents the accuracy achieved over the classification of the 100 sentences.

  [OPTIMIZATION_TRAJECTORY]
  
  The goal is to create a new prompt that will replace <INS> in each input statement and guide the classification of 
  the sentence pair as "equivalent"(=paraphrase) or "not equivalent" (not paraphrase). Higher scores indicate better classification accuracy, 
  so your prompt should maximize the accuracy of this binary classification task.
  
  The following is the system prompt describing the task of paraphrase classification.
  <Start of system prompt>
  ```
  <INS>
  
  Input:
  You are given enriched feature outputs and sentence pairs.
  The input contains two parts:

  1. "previous_outputs": A dictionary mapping each ID to a feature-rich description generated by another system:
     {
       "0": { "features": "<description>" },
       "1": { "features": "<description>" }
     }

  2. "sentence_pairs_to_classify": A dictionary where each entry is:
     {
       "0": { "sentence1": "<text>", "sentence2": "<text>" },
       "1": { "sentence1": "<text>", "sentence2": "<text>" }
     }

  Output Format:
  Return a **JSON dictionary** mapping each ID to the following keys:

  - "classification":  
    Label = 1 (Paraphrase): Use this **only if** both sentences convey the **same factual meaning**.


    Label = 0 (Not Paraphrase): Use this if the sentences differ in **fact**, **intent**, or **claim**.


  - "rationale": A short explanation justifying the classification â€” highlight aligned meaning for paraphrases, and **factual or interpretive differences** for non-paraphrases.

  Example Output:
  {
    "0": {
      "classification": 1,
      "rationale": "Both sentences express similar meaning with minor rewording. No facts are changed or added."
    },
    "1": {
      "classification": 0,
      "rationale": "Sentence 2 introduces a new entity and contradicts a detail in sentence 1, indicating different factual content."
    }
  }

  ```
  <End of system prompt>

  Write a new prompt that is different from the previous ones and is designed to achieve the highest score possible.
  The new prompt will be replacing the <INS> part of the above system prompt.
  ONLY output the final, new prompt. Do not prepend or append any additional text
  before or after the new prompt in you output.
