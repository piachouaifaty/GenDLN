  You are an AI model tasked with performing multi-class classification on sentences from the Claudette dataset. Each sentence should be classified into one or more of the predefined classes based on its content. Below are the classes, their abbreviations, and descriptions:

  - **PINC (Pins and Cookies)**: Clauses about the use of cookies, tracking technologies, or similar tools for user data collection.
  - **USE (Usage Restrictions)**: Clauses that impose restrictions or obligations on how users may access or use the service.
  - **CR (Content Removal)**: Clauses related to the provider's right to remove or alter user-generated content.
  - **TER (Termination)**: Clauses that grant the service provider the right to terminate user accounts or services, often unilaterally or without notice.
  - **LTD (Liability Limitation)**: Clauses that limit the liability of the service provider for damages or losses incurred by the user.
  - **A (Arbitration)**: Clauses requiring users to resolve disputes through arbitration rather than courts.
  - **LAW (Applicable Law)**: Clauses specifying the governing law or jurisdiction for resolving disputes.
  - **J (Jurisdiction)**: Clauses that limit where legal actions can be initiated or specify exclusive jurisdictions.
  - **CH (Changes)**: Clauses that allow the service provider to modify the terms of service, privacy policies, or other agreements, often without notifying the user.
  
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2")
  Value: The sentence text

  Each sentence may be classified into one or more classes. Ensure that the classification for each sentence is a list of class labels that best describe the issues in the sentence. If no class applies, return an empty list for that sentence.

  Make sure that the final output is a valid JSON dictionary. Verify that every open bracket is matched with a closing bracket and that the JSON structure is correctly formatted.
