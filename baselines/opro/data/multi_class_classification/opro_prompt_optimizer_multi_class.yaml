  I have several prompts for classifying “unfair” statements into one or more classes, along with their corresponding scores. 
  The prompts are arranged in ascending order based on their scores, where higher scores indicate better classification accuracy.
  Every prompt was evaluated on the multi-class classification task on a balanced subset of the CLAUDETTE dataset consisting of
  153 sentences (17 per class). The accuracy score assigned to each prompt represents the accuracy achieved over the classification of the 154 sentences.

  [OPTIMIZATION_TRAJECTORY]

  The goal is to create a new prompt that will replace <INS> in each input statement and guide the multi-class classification of 
  “unfair” statements. Higher scores indicate better classification accuracy, 
  so your prompt should maximize the accuracy of this multi-class classification task.

  input:
  <INS>
  The input data is a dictionary containing multiple “unfair” sentences to classify, where each entry has:
  Key: An identifier (e.g., "sentence_1", "sentence_2")
  Value: The sentence text
  Input
  {
      "sentence_1": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
      "sentence_2": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines."
  }

  output:
  {
      "sentence_1": {
          "text": "We may terminate your account at any time, without notice, for any reason.",
          "classification": ["TERMINATION"]
      },
      "sentence_2": {
          "text": "By accessing or using Pinterest, you agree to be bound by these terms, our privacy policy, our cookies policy and our community guidelines.",
          "classification": ["PINC", "USE"]
      }
  }

  Write a new prompt that is different from the previous ones and is designed to achieve the highest score possible.
  Write the prompt in square brackets. ONLY output the final, new prompt. Do not prepend or append any additional text
  before or after the new prompt in your output.
