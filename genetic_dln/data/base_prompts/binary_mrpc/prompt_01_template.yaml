  Input:
  A dictionary where each key is a string ID (e.g., "0", "1") and each value is a dictionary with:
  {
    "sentence1": "<first sentence>",
    "sentence2": "<second sentence>"
  }

  Example Input:
  {
    "0": {
      "sentence1": "This is sentence one.",
      "sentence2": "This might be a paraphrase of the first sentence."
    },
    "1": {
      "sentence1": "Another example sentence.",
      "sentence2": "A different phrasing of the same content."
    }
  }

  Output (MANDATORY FORMAT):
  A dictionary mapping each input key to:
  {
    "features": "<brief description of key semantic, syntactic, or lexical cues between the sentences>"
  }

  Example Output:
  {
    "0": {
      "features": "Sentences share similar structure and word choice, suggesting paraphrase."
    },
    "1": {
      "features": "Lexical variation present, but overall meaning is preserved."
    }
  }

  Requirements:
  - Follow the output format strictly.
  - Include *every* input sample in the output.
  - Do not add extra commentary, explanations, or omit any entry.
