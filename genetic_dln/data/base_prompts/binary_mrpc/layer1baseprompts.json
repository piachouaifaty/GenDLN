    "You are a linguistic analysis model specialized in paraphrase tasks. For each input pair, extract key semantic and syntactic features relevant for paraphrase classification.",

    "Analyze each sentence pair to identify meaningful features that help determine if the two sentences are paraphrases.",

    "Given a list of sentence pairs, extract discriminative features for each pair that can support downstream paraphrase detection.",

    "You are tasked with analyzing sentence pairs. For each pair, return a compact description of important features that would help in classifying paraphrase relationships.",

    "Analyze the input sentence pairs and extract useful features that would support a classifier in detecting semantic equivalence.",

    "You are a feature extraction system for paraphrase detection. For each sentence pair, output key comparison features in the specified format.",

    "Given sentence pairs, identify and summarize linguistic or semantic cues that are relevant for determining paraphrasing.",

    "For each pair of sentences, write a brief set of features that capture their semantic, lexical, and structural alignment.",

    "Inspect each input sentence pair and generate a meaningful feature description that reflects their similarity or difference in meaning.",


    "You are a natural language understanding model. For each sentence pair, extract features that reveal differences or overlaps in meaning and expression.",


    "Identify semantic relationships and stylistic variations in each sentence pair. Output concise features that explain their alignment or divergence.",

    "For every input pair, generate a feature-based comparison that highlights differences in structure, meaning, or terminology.",

    "You are helping a classifier understand sentence similarity. Extract key features that could guide a model in deciding paraphrase equivalence.",

    "Assess each sentence pair for shared meanings, nuanced differences, or structural shifts. Provide these insights as short, structured features.",

    "Your goal is to support a paraphrase detection system by extracting features that capture lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties of sentence pairs.",

    "Review each sentence pair and write a concise summary of alignment cues and linguistic differences that may affect paraphrase detection.",

    "As a sentence-level feature extractor, outline the textual signals that could be used to determine if two statements express the same idea.",

    "Examine each sentence pair and extract distinguishing features that would help a downstream model judge paraphrase likelihood.",

    "Your job is to find patterns in sentence pairs that indicate whether they express similar or different meanings. Output a compact list of relevant features.",


    "You are a linguistic alignment engine. Identify whether key predicates, named entities, and relationships are preserved across the sentence pair.",

    "Highlight phrasing shifts, information asymmetry, or reordering patterns that could influence whether the sentence pair is semantically aligned.",

    "For each input pair, extract lexical and structural markers — including synonym usage, clause structure, and entity alignment — that contribute to paraphrase detection.",

    "Extract the central premise of each of the two sentences, what information does each convey?",

    "As an expert writer, would you say the two sentences convey the same main idea? What would you say is the point of each sentence?",

    "Could the two sentence reasonably be exchanged within a text without changing the general meaning of the text? Why or why not?"
